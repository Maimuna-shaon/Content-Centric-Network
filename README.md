Content-Centric Networking (CCN) represents a
paradigm shift in data communication by focusing on the
content itself rather than the traditional host-based approach of
delivering data from a specific source. In CCN, data is requested
and retrieved based on content names, which facilitates more
efficient data distribution, particularly in scenarios involving
multimedia and large-scale content delivery. This paper delves
into the structural and functional aspects of CCN names, offering
a comprehensive discussion on their types, purposes, and mecha-
nisms underlying their use in caching and forwarding. We present
a performance evaluation of a CCN network simulated using the
inet framework, analyzing content delivery diversity scenarios.
The results emphasize CCNâ€™s potential in addressing the evolving
content-oriented demands of modern networks, underscoring its
scalability and adaptability.
